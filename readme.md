Page scrolling in vanilla JS. Based on [Vanilla Page Scrolling](https://pawelgrzybek.com/page-scroll-in-vanilla-javascript/) by Pawel Grzybek with a few extras thrown in.

Set your anchor ID, scroll speed and top offset within the data attributes and you're away.

```html
<a class="anchor" data-anchor="#section-1" data-speed="500" data-offset="0" href="#">Link</a>
```
